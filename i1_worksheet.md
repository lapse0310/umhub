## Iteration 1 Worksheet
### Adding a feature
In Iteration 1, we added the feature that allows users to view the majors on our app.

On the home page, the users will be able to click on "click to proceed" and then view a list of majors offered by the university, then should be able to click on one of the majors.

### Exceptional Code
This is where we used [Exceptional Code](UMHUB/app/src/main/java/comp3350/umhub/presentation/MajorsActivity.java). We provided try-catch exception handlers which print out the exception in case it encounters a null value. 


### SOLID
Here is the link to [SOLID violation](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a01/group-8-overfeed-the-world/-/issues/20) found in group 8's repository. 

### Agile Planning
We pushed back the features -"Show the illustration of degree plan" and "Click on subject to view more" to Iteration 2. We first started pushing into the developer branch and then changed our branching strategy to gitflow.
