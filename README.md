## Purpose
UMHUB will be used to guide students to choose the correct program and courses under their degree path. It will show an outline of the course order the students should enrol in and provide an overview of different subjects and their professors. Users can choose to join the system to access other actions, including rating courses and professors. Each user is able to either create a personal account by signing up or can be guest user to have a brief overview of the system.

## How to run it
1) Run the project folder UMHUB-7/app with Emulator Pixel 3a API 30.

2) The application will display the Login/guest page.

3) New users can sign up by pressing the login button and then entering the username and password fields and pressing sign up button. Previous users can enter the username and password into their fields and press the login button.

5) After signing up/login, the users should be able to view the majors and after selecting one of these, the list of programs will be displayed. Then, the user can select the desired program and can view the courses underneath it.

6) The user should be able to view and rate the professors/courses as well.

## Branching strategy

This project follows the Gitflow branching strategy. Different features are worked upon in different branches and then mergerd into the developer branch, discarding the feature branch, for testing the project together and then pushed onto the master once it is a stable release.
