## A one-stop-shop for all university students' needs.

This application is mainly targeted towards students currently enrolled at the University of Manitoba, though it can also be of use to prospective students and recent graduates. Students can easily see all the courses they can take in a certain program at one place and also look at what different courses include in their content. They are also able to connect with other university students. Past students can provide information on different courses and their experience and also provide ratings to the professors. Students can also buy and sell used books instead of scrambling here and there. Prospective students can get to know what kind of courses they can take at the university, helping them plan ahead.
