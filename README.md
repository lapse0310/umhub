## A one-stop-shop for all university students' needs.

This application is mainly targeted towards students currently enrolled at the University of Manitoba, though it can also be of use to prospective students and recent graduates. Students can easily see all the courses they can take in a certain program at one place and also look at what different courses include in their content. They are also able to connect with other university students. Past students can provide information on different courses and their experience and also provide ratings to the professors. Students can also buy and sell used books instead of scrambling here and there. Prospective students can get to know what kind of courses they can take at the university, helping them plan ahead. This is an awesome app.

Success metric
The short term success metric is to attract all students in the UM  to use it, and in the long term we can have the options of scaling it up for use in other universities/colleges. Since much of the app relies on students contribution, we expect a successful app to have its user base contributing and updating the necessary links to their course section resources (Telegram/ WhatsApp/ Discord group chat), and 20-30 daily user posts/interactions across all forums (Buy & Sell, Questions and Answer Forum, Peer Tutor Matching). Ultimately, our goal is to still to help students by making information as accessible to them as possible
